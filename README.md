SIGNIFYD client plugin for PHP. Intstall with Composer (https://getcomposer.org/)

### 1.	Overview

This document will give an overview on the available methods in the Signifyd PHP library. Also examples for this methods will be provided.
### 2.	Prerequisites

In order to authenticate with the API you need to provide your API key. You can find your API key on your account page.
### 3.	SignifydAPI CLASS

The main class that does the abstraction between your code and the API is the class SignifydAPI which can be found under namespace "Signifyd\Core", located under lib/Core/SignifydAPI.php.

In order to instantiate the main class you will need to instantiate the settings class first as the constructor of the Main class requires a settings object to be passed. The settings class is SignifydSettings can be found under the namespace "Signifyd\Core", located under lib/Core/SignifydSettings.php.

Example:
```php
<?php 
    // instantiating the settings class
    $settings = new \Signifyd\Core\SignifydSettings();
    $settings->apiKey = 'YOUR API KEY';

    // instantiating the api class
    $apiInstance = new \Signifyd\Core\SignifydAPI($settings);
?>
```
